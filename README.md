## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Uber trip data. As a Data Analyst at Uber, I investigated 1,156 trip logs to identify patterns in ride categories, peak booking hours, and seasonal trends. These insights are designed to help the operations team optimize driver supply and target marketing efforts effectively.

## 🧠 Business Questions & Data-Driven Answers

| # | Business Question | Findings & Insights | Strategic Impact |
|:--|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | **Most Popular Category?** | **Business Class** is the dominant category for Uber bookings. | Helps in allocating premium vehicle resources to high-density business hubs. |
| **2** | **Primary Trip Purpose?** | Most rides are booked for **Meetings** and **Meal/Entertain**. | Opportunity for B2B partnerships with corporate offices and top-tier restaurants. |
| **3** | **Peak Booking Time?** | Demand peaks during the **Afternoon and Evening** slots. | Critical for managing **Surge Pricing** and driver shift handovers. |
| **4** | **Low Demand Season?** | Bookings drop significantly in **January and February**. | Recommendation: Launch "New Year" promo codes to boost stagnant demand. |
| **5** | **Busiest Day of the Week?** | **Fridays** witness the highest volume of trip requests. | Ensures maximum fleet availability for the weekend-transition surge. |
| **6** | **Standard Trip Distance?** | Most trips are short-haul, typically **under 20 miles**. | Focus on "Last Mile" transit solutions and micro-mobility optimization. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `Pandas` (Data Cleaning), `NumPy` (Math), `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (Visuals).
* **Techniques:** Feature Engineering (Time/Day extraction), Missing Value Imputation, Categorical Analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features of the Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled over 500 missing values in the 'Purpose' column to ensure analytical integrity.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Segregated data into 'Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', and 'Night' to identify peak activity.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Used Bar Plots, Box Plots, and Distplots to explain complex mileage distributions to stakeholders.
